Who?    So far it's all me: amanda.owen@gmail.com.
What?   Supposed to be an app that will monitor TV 
        listings an email when a new series of a
        specified TV show is due to start in the next
        week. Further extensions to the scope are 
        already planned.
When?   Work started April 2012.
Where?  UK based TV schedules are being looked at for 
        the moment. Not sure how easily expanded this is
        to other countries at the moment.
How?    So far this is being done via
        - GitHub
        - Python
        - Google App Engine
        None of which I have prior experience with.
        So this could be a bit fun!
